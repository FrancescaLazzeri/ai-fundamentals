# AI Fundamentals

This repo contains some labs to help you get started with Artificial Intelligence (AI) using Microsoft Azure. These labs are designed to introduce you to some of the core concepts in AI, and the services in Azure that help you apply those concepts to build intelligent applications.

The labs are provided as notebooks that contain explanations of key AI, instructions to configure AI services in Azure, and code that you can run to use the services you've configured. Don't worry too much about the details of the code syntax in the labs, but instead focus on understanding the types of solution that you can build using AI services in Azure.

## Before You Start

To complete the labs, you'll need the following:

- A Microsoft Azure subscription. If you don't already have one, you can sign up for a free trial at [https://azure.microsoft.com](https://azure.microsoft.com).
- A Visual Studio Online environment. This provides a hosted instance of Visual Studio Code, in which you'll be able to run the notebooks for the lab exercises. To set up this environment:
    1. Browse to [https://online.visualstudio.com](https://online.visualstudio.com)
    2. Click **Get Started**.
    3. Sign in using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription.
    4. Click **Create environment**. If you don't already have a Visual Studio Online plan, create one. This is used to track resource utlization by your Visual Studio Online environments. Then create an environment with the following settings:
        - **Environment Name**: *A name for your environment - for example, **ai-environment**.*
        - **Git Repository**:
